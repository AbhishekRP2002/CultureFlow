Masabi

Masabi is a London-based engineering outfit providing mobile ticketing solutions to the transport industry. The mantra at Masabi is #LoveWhatYouDo. They believe firmly in the concept that the products they build are only as good as the people that build them. As a result, the business works hard to create a culture of collaboration, innovation and communication.

The three founders of Masabi are still on board since the company’s inception 10 years ago. The company values, vision and culture are driven from the top down and underpinned by a coaching and problem-solving ethos. The business supports flexible working and is set up for collaborative working with regular team meetings, company-wide meetings and team lunches. Social engagement is actively encouraged.

Masabi doesn’t relate at all to a traditional hierarchical management model. It describes itself as having an agile working culture supporting autonomy and greater developmental opportunities.

The business successfully blends management with self-governance, regular evaluation, and engagement tracking to achieve a healthy focus on results.


Employees at XYZ Company are overworked and underappreciated. There is a constant pressure to meet unrealistic deadlines, and management does not provide the necessary resources or support to help us succeed. The work environment is toxic, with rumors and gossip spreading quickly among colleagues. The lack of transparency and communication from upper management adds to the already high levels of stress and anxiety. Overall, the company culture is toxic, and it's taking a toll on the mental and physical health of employees."I feel like my ideas are never taken seriously by management, which makes me feel undervalued and demotivated."
"The lack of transparency around decision-making processes makes it difficult to feel like I have any input in how the company operates."
"There's a pervasive sense of cliquishness within the team, which makes it hard to feel like I truly belong here."
"The long hours and high-pressure environment have created a work-life balance that's unsustainable for me and my family."
"I've noticed a lot of favoritism among managers, which makes it hard to trust that promotions and rewards are based on merit."
"The lack of diversity and inclusion within the company is concerning, and it's clear that some employees are not being given the same opportunities as others."
