ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform that automates workflows, manages projects and simplifies collaboration for companies. As a small company, ServiceNow recognizes how much of an impact each new addition has on its corporate culture, and encourages everyone to give input and lead new culture, diversity and inclusion initiatives. 

“Growing our local culture is a constant evolution and discussion item, but we’ve already developed some traditions,” Ryan Wells, senior technical program manager at ServiceNow, told Built In.

The company sponsors team outings like karaoke, bowling and baseball games to welcome new hires into the fold. Inclusivity is a major part of ServiceNow’s culture, so when one employee brought lunch from home while others ate out, they came together and brought lunch back to the office so that everyone could eat together.
