This is an NLP-based tool or app designed for culture analytics, built with the following key features:

* Language Detection & Translation: The app can detect the language of collected content and translate the text data into language of the user's choice.
* Context Identification: Using NLP techniques like topic modeling and keyword extraction, the app can identify the context of web content and ensure accurate analysis of conversations in different regions.
* Sentiment Analysis: The app applies sentiment analysis algorithms to identify positive, negative, or neutral sentiments expressed in conversations related to culture building.
* Contact Information Extraction: Information extraction techniques are implemented to extract contact information such as names, phone numbers, and email IDs of stakeholders responsible for culture building in identified enterprises.
* Reporting and Visualization: A dashboard is developed to generate comprehensive reports and visualizations that provide insights into culture-building conversations, including trends, patterns, and key findings.
* Chatbot: A chatbot is integrated to enhance the user experience and allow for natural language interactions.

The purpose of this app is to provide valuable insights into culture building for enterprises. With its powerful NLP techniques, the app can analyze conversations and identify key trends and patterns that can help enterprises make data-driven decisions.
