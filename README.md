This is an NLP-based tool or app designed for culture analytics, built with the following key features:

* Language Detection & Translation: The app can detect the language of collected content and translate the text data into language of the user's choice.
* Context Identification: Using NLP techniques like topic modeling and keyword extraction, the app can identify the context of web content and ensure accurate analysis of conversations in different regions.
* Sentiment Analysis: The app applies sentiment analysis algorithms to identify positive, negative, or neutral sentiments expressed in conversations related to culture building.
* Contact Information Extraction: Information extraction techniques are implemented to extract contact information such as names, phone numbers, and email IDs of stakeholders responsible for culture building in identified enterprises.
* Reporting and Visualization: A dashboard is developed to generate comprehensive reports and visualizations that provide insights into culture-building conversations, including trends, patterns, and key findings.
* Chatbot: A chatbot is integrated to enhance the user experience and allow for natural language interactions.
